# portfolio

Hi, I'm Kristi. I'm a writer and this is my personal portfolio website. [krimariko.github.io](https://krimariko.github.io/portfolio/)

## About this site
This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a super fast static site generator. The theme I use is [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo).

Content is all in Markdown and the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. I have continous deployment set up with GitHub Actions. Whenever I push changes to this repo, a workflow is triggered and GitHub automatically rebuilds and deploys the site.
