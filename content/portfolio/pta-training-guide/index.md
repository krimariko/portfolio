I created this piece for the [UW technical writing certificate](/experience#education) which I completed in November 2023.

## Overview
I wrote a training guide for a parent volunteer taking on the role of sponsorship chair of my PTA. 

I am the current PTA sponsorship chair. No training documents exist for this position and other PTA board members, even the executive team, have varying levels of familiarity with the sponsorship program. When I took over the role at the beginning of the school year, I had to cobble together the job with limited direction and assistance.

As a result of this experience, I wanted to create a blueprint for the role to make for a  smoother onboarding process for future sponsorship chairs.

## Document constraints
The training guide needed to be easy to update and maintain for users with varying levels of technical ability. Since PTA documents are housed on Google Drive, I chose to create the document in Google Docs for accessibility and ease of updating.
