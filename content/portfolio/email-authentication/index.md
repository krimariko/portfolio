Flow chart explaining three major email authentication protocols. Works as a visual primer for diagnosing email deliverability issues at a high level. Aimed at marketing professionals.

This was a group project completed for the UW technical writing program. I worked with two other students to complete three short-form projects in 3-week sprints. Each member rotated among the roles of writer, editor, and production specialist over the 3-project span.

I acted as production specialist on this piece. I've made some edits to this piece since completing it for the certificate program.
