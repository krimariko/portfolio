I created this guide while working as an [editorial assistant at Education.com](/experience#product--editorial--educationcomhttpswwweducationcom). The document was originally completed in 2010 and adopted as our official in-house style guide. It was used for training incoming editors and interns and as a reference for our large pool of contributing freelance writers and content creators.

This project came about after I saw the need to create a standard set of guidelines defining our voice and editorial style to ensure we were training new hires effectively and uniformly. I pitched the idea for a style guide to the team and got the go-ahead to develop it myself.

## Background

When I started at the company, we didn't have a style guide. We had a collection of loose guidelines and conventions generally agreed upon by the team, but they weren't formalized or written down anywhere central. When it came time to train anyone new on our style (and this was often, as we contracted new freelancers on a regular basis), we'd send a list of bullet points over email. As you can guess, this wasn't the most reliable system and style rules were often communicated unevenly.

After getting involved with hiring and training, it was clear to me that a style guide would be immensely helpful in ensuring that our team and all new hires were aligned on our voice and style.

## Education.com Style Guide (2010)
This guide provides direction on Education.com’s brand voice and tone, grammar and style conventions, and how to write titles, introductions, and abstracts. It was developed for our editorial team and is most relevant to activity and worksheet content.

These guidelines are recommendations more than a prescriptive formula (aside from a few exceptions, which are noted in the guide). We encourage you to cultivate your own voice and style within the Education.com brand. Every member of the editorial team has their own way of doing and writing, and we’re here to support you in finding yours.

## Voice and Tone
Key to finding success as a writer here is nailing our voice and tone. Education.com is a fun, welcoming, supportive place and we aim to reflect that personality in everything we say.
What’s the difference between voice and tone? Put simply, you can think of voice as what we say and tone as how we say it.

**Voice** is consistent and reflects the style and personality of our brand.  
**Tone** is more flexible and changes depending on the content and the user’s context.

### Voice Guiding Principles
- **Be conversational.** We want our site to feel like having a conversation with a favorite aunt or older sister at the kitchen table. Informal, friendly, and inviting.
- **Be playful.** As creators of content for kids and families, we gravitate naturally toward playfulness. 
- **Be natural.** Avoid sounding forced, contrived, or affected or your writing could come across as overly precious or even sarcastic. Don’t force the fun; if you feel a sentence is awkward, it probably is! Rely on your own instincts and judgment when it comes to making an editorial call (and we’ll help you along the way).
   Tip: Read your writing aloud to catch clunky phrasing.
- **Be clear.** We love to have fun with language and are big fans of playful phrasing, but style should never get in the way of meaning. Above all our writing should be straightforward and easy to understand.

### Notes on Tone

## Grammar and Style
[add intro]
- **Use contractions.** Contractions make writing feel less stiff and formal and should be used in most instances unless doing so feels awkward.

- **Use colloquialisms**, e.g. “let’s face it” or “in a jiffy.” Like contractions, colloquialisms keep your writing casual and fun.

- **Use alliteration**, but in moderate doses. Alliteration is catchy and fun to read and can help expand your writing vocabulary by encouraging you to think of creative ways of expressing an idea. Best applied in moderation, though, as it’s very easy to cross over into the overly silly or cutesy if used too much.

- **Use exclamation points**, but again, in moderation. Avoid tacking on an exclamation point to the end of a sentence to try to make it sound fun and exciting. Aim to write engaging text independent of punctuation, and reserve exclamation points for the sentences that really call for them. As a rule, limit exclamation points to one per introduction.
- **Avoid using jargon or overly technical or academic terms**, what we fondly call “teacher talk.” If you’re unsure whether the average reader would be familiar with a term, try to find a more common alternative. If it’s necessary to use an uncommon term, provide a clear and simple explanation.

## Writing a Title
The perfect title is clear and descriptive yet interesting and entices the reader to click through. Readers skim titles to find content that interests them, and if a title doesn’t attract or is unclear, they’ll move on.

### Guidelines: Activites & Worksheets
- Titles should tell the reader what the activity or worksheet is about, in as fun and snappy a way as possible.
- For activities, titles take the form of an imperative, beginning with a verb.

  Season Art
  {{< /alert>}}
  {{< alert "check" >}}
  Sculpt the Seasons
  {{< /alert >}}

- Where possible and appropriate, use alliteration and rhyme to inject fun into a mundane subject.

  {{< alert "check" >}}
  Fraction Action: Practice ½
  {{< /alert >}}
  {{< alert "check" >}}
  Get into Grammar: Plural Nouns
  {{< /alert >}}

- When choosing words, try to be specific; avoid using a general term when a specific one is available.

  Make a Toy Box
  {{< /alert>}}
  {{< alert "check" >}}
  Build a Cardboard Play Chest
  {{< /alert >}}

- For worksheets that form a series, choose an introductory phrase that describes the series as a whole, and begin each title with that phrase. In the second half of the title, specify what the worksheet is about.

- SEO: Always keep SEO (search engine optimization) top of mind. Make sure your title contains the top keyword related to the activity or worksheet. Don’t pepper your title with obscure words that users would be unlikely to type into a search field. Ask yourself: what terms would I search if I wanted to find this?

## Writing an Introduction
When writing an introduction, think short and sweet. Keep these questions in mind as you write: 
1. What is this activity/worksheet all about?
2. What are the learning benefits?
3. Why should users care?

### Guidelines
- Length:
   - Activities: 3-5 sentences
   - Worksheet intros: 3-4 sentences
- Open with a snappy hook to grab the attention of the reader and set a fun tone.
- Spend 1-2 sentences introducing the activity or worksheet and explaining the learning benefits. Avoid giving instructions in the intro; any instructional information should be in the steps.
- Pick 1-2 major learning areas to highlight and only if they really make sense. For a paper bag puppet craft that has a step asking kids to cut various shapes out of construction paper, shape practice is involved but not a major learning benefit. Instead, pretend play is a better fit.
To list fine motor skills or not: Only list fine motor skills if it’s truly one of the primary benefits of the craft, such as stitching. Nearly every craft improves fine motor skills in some way.
- Avoid overusing “your child” and particularly the infamous phrase “your child will.” We think it’s stiff and sounds a bit stale.

  {{< /alert >}}
  {{< alert "check" >}}

  {{< /alert >}}

- Conclude with a short, fun sentence that wraps up the intro nicely and allows for a smooth transition to the activity body (instructional steps).

## Writing an Abstract
The abstract is the snippet of introductory text that appears under a title when browsing or searching activities or worksheets. Like titles, abstracts play a part in enticing users to read further. A good abstract gives a snapshot of what the activity or worksheet is all about in a clear, concise, and fun way.

### Guidelines
- You don’t have to write the abstract from scratch. Choose a sentence from the activity or worksheet introduction that gives a good overview of the content, then tweak it a bit to make it more direct and compelling. It’s good practice to alter the abstract, even if only slightly, so the intro doesn’t feel too redundant.
- Abstract length should be 1-2 sentences and no longer than two lines. You want to strike a balance between providing enough information to be clear but not overwhelming with a large block of text. A brief snapshot of the content is all that’s needed. Always remember: a good abstract is a short abstract.
