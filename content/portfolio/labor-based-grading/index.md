Presentation on the merits of labor-based grading over traditional grading methods. This piece is aimed at educators and administrators at an online coding school.

This was a three-person group project completed for the UW technical writing program. We completed three quick projects in 3-week sprints. Each member rotated among the roles of writer, editor, and production specialist over the 3 projects. 

I acted as editor on this piece.
