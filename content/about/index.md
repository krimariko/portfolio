# Hi, I'm Kristi

I'm a writer making the jump into `technical writing`. Previously worked in product and editorial at [education.com](https://www.education.com/).

I recently completed the [Technical Writing certificate program](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing) at the University of Washington.
