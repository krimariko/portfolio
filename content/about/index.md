# Hi, I'm Kristi

I'm a writer making the jump into technical writing with a background in product and online content in the tech industry.

I'm actively looking for a position and open to both FTE and contract work. I'm based in the Seattle metro area. If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me at <kbierut@gmail.com>.

Most recently I was a [product manager at Education.com](/experience#work), an edtech startup based in the SF Bay Area (now owned by IXL). I've done a range of writing over the course of my career, with a focus on web content and bringing online products to life. Everything from product documentation and UX microcopy to art show reviews and instructional activities for kids.

After becoming a parent in 2013, I took a career break to devote my time fully to raising my kids. Since coming back from hiatus in late 2022, I've decided to return to my writing roots and pivot toward technical writing in this new chapter of work.

In November 2023 I completed the [Technical Writing certificate program](/experience#education) at the University of Washington.

I may not have been called a technical writer in my past work, but I've created lots of documentation as a product manager and editor. Being part of a tiny two-person product team at a startup meant covering a wide range of roles and tasks--everything from writing the FAQ and terms of service for a subscription product to creating an in-house style guide. I've also done a fair amount of UX writing and collaborated often with design and editorial to test and improve UX copy in user flows across the site.

Why technical writing? To me it feels like a natural progression that builds on my past work and weaves in many of my personal strengths and interests. It combines many of the elements of product management that I enjoyed like collaborating on cross-functional teams (particularly enjoyed working with engineers) with my love of words and user advocacy and learning new things and thinking through the intracacies of how best to structure and present information to make it as robust, accessible, and useful as possible to everyone who needs it.

## Hobbies and interests
Before I was a writer, I was a reader. I've always loved words and narrative and the mechanics of storytelling. You'll never find me without something to read. I'm partial to fiction but have lately gotten into listening to nonfiction. I'm also subscribed to a bunch of writers on Substack and probably spend as much time reading and thinking about the art and craft of writing as I do actually doing the thing.

**Other things I love:**
- Cooking and food
- Plants and working in the garden
- Intricate crafts that take forever to complete
- Fashion history and personal style
- Hiking in damp PNW woods

**Currently thinking about:**
- [Digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
- Systems for personal knowledge management
- Alternative cultural and historical conceptions of time
