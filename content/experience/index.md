I'm a writer moving into technical communication with 6+ years of experience in product and web content in the tech industry. I'm interested in software documentation (both for developers and end users) and UX writing.

Most recently I was a product manager at [Education.com](https://www.education.com/). I've done a range of writing over the course of my career--everything from product documentation and UX microcopy to instructional activities for kids.

In 2013 I put my career on hold to parent my kids full time. I officially ended my hiatus in late 2022, and have since been working on [expanding my tech writing skillset](#certificate-professional-technical-writing), [volunteering](#volunteer-work), and fine-tuning my plans for this new chapter of work.

## Work
### Product & Editorial | [Education.com](https://www.education.com/)
2009-2013  
*Redwood City, CA*  
**Product Manager**, 2012-2013  
**Associate Product Manager**, 2011-2012  
**Product Assistant**, 2010-2011  
**Editorial Assistant**, 2009-2011

At the time I worked there, Education.com was a mid-size startup (~30 people) offering a range of digital and printable K-12 learning resources. The company was at a pivotal point in its growth, on the verge of evolving from an ad-reliant content site into a subscription-based edtech platform.

A large part of my later product work focused on building and launching a paid member subscription program. It was a major success in its first year and turned the company profitable within 4 years.

**As a product manager:**
- Led the end-to-end creation and launch of Education.com Plus, a premium subscription product that marked our entry into ecommerce. Oversaw all parts of the product lifecycle in collaboration with a cross-functional team following agile dev processes.
  - Conducted user research pre- and post-release. Developed personas and user stories to identify needs of key user segments.
  - Wrote all internal and user-facing product documentation, including product requirements, Terms of Service, and customer FAQ.
  - Performed all QA testing and deployed A/B tests to optimize conversions.
- Helped establish a data-driven approach to decision making within the company.
  - Conducted in-depth analyses of traffic and user engagement metrics using Adobe, Google, and internal analytics tools to identify areas for growth.
  - Launched our A/B testing program using Optimizely. Designed and deployed experiments to increase membership signups and user engagement and guide UX/design decisions.
  - Optimized UX copy in key user flows across the site in collaboration with editorial and design.
- Managed the school data API support inbox. Resolved user issues in partnership with engineers.

**As an editor:**
- Managed a team of graphic designers creating printable worksheets. Led content development from strategy to final editing.
- Hired and trained 2 editorial interns who later joined as full-time staff.
- Created our [in-house style guide](/portfolio/style-guide) after identifying the need and pitching the idea to management.
- Edited, wrote, and managed a variety of website content including instructional activities and articles.

<!-- 
Education.com is an online platform offering a range of digital and printable learning resources. I first joined as a paid editorial intern and was soon after hired on as a full-time employee. After a year and some, I began splitting my time between editorial and product. I made the full switch to product manager in 2011.

At the time I worked there, Education.com was at a pivotal point in its growth. It was a mid-size startup (~30 people) quickly hurtling toward a major financial decision point. Its reliance on ad revenue was becoming unsustainable; if the company was to continue growing at pace, it needed to diversify revenue streams.

### Staff Writer (Contract) | [ArtSlant](https://phantomgallery.blogspot.com/2019/04/artslant-is-shutting-down-thank-you.html)
2008-2009  
*San Francisco, CA (Remote)*

ArtSlant (now defunct) was an online art publication and artist portal, a community hub connecting artists, galleries, and art lovers in cities across the US and Europe.

I was on their roster of writers for the SF Bay Area doing reviews of local art shows. I researched and selected the shows I wanted to review, attended, and wrote them up. I generally wrote two full reviews and 1 short-form "flavor piece" about local spots of aesthetic or cultural interest (piece of street art, funky alleyway, anything) per month.

Sadly I no longer have the work I did for ArtSlant, as the website was taken down and my local copies have been lost.

### Grant Writer (Contract) | Dunn Write Communications
2007-2009  
*Remote*

I worked freelance for a grant writing consulting firm.
- Wrote and edited grant proposals and letters of inquiry for non-profit clients in youth advocacy and education.
- Researched and identified potential funders and performed audience analysis to ensure alignment of goals and proposal strategy.

## Volunteer Work
### Highland Terrace PTA
2022-present  
*Shoreline, WA*  
**Communication Team - Website and Newsletter**  
**Sponsorship Chair**

I currently volunteer with the PTA in several areas.

As a member of the communication team I run the [PTA website](https://highlandterracepta.org) in WordPress. This mostly entails writing and managing content, with some light backend work. I also send out the monthly PTA newsletter with Mailchimp.

As the sponsorship chair I engage local businesses as sponsors in support of our PTA fundraising goals. We have many regular sponsors who return every year. My work focuses on maintaining relationships with our existing roster of businesses and seeking new ones to bring into the fold.

I created a [training guide](/portfolio/pta-training-guide) for the sponsorship role as a portfolio project for the UW tech writing program.
