I'm a writer and editor with a background in online content and product management. 

Most recently I worked as a product manager at an edtech startup in the SF Bay Area. I've done many kinds of writing over the course of my career, with a focus on web content. Everything from product documentation and instructional activities for kids to grant proposals and art show reviews.

About 10 years ago I made the decision to take a career hiatus to parent my kids full-time.
