[{"content":" Starwipe API documentation site View project on Github\nThis was my final group portfolio project for the UW technical writing program which I completed in November 2023.\nOverview #We built a mock API documentation site for an imaginary photo app we invented and named Starwipe.\nProject goals:\nLearn how to document REST APIs Create a representation of an API documentation site using industry tools and processes Timeframe: 9 weeks\nMethod:\nInterview software engineers to understand API documentation needs Design a simple REST API following the OpenAPI specification Use documentation tool to render OAS spec Complete with supporting Markdown articles to add context to the API reference Deploy with Stoplight Aside from some initial content drafting in Google Docs, we built and deployed the site entirely with Stoplight.\nStoplight\u0026rsquo;s API design editor simplified the process of defining our API and enabled us to create an OAS spec with minimal hand coding.\nI worked with 5 other students on this project. It was an ambitious undertaking that required extensive background research and rapid learning. We came into the project with minimal knowledge of APIs and faced a steep learning curve. I worked through a large chunk of Tom Johnson\u0026rsquo;s API documentation course to get myself up to speed and found it an invaluable resource.\nBeyond our research on REST APIs, a crucial part of our learning was talking to our target audience, software engineers. This step was hugely informative and enabled us to define a set of documentation best practices that set the shape and direction of the final product.\nUser research: What developers had to say about API documentation #We talked to software developers about what they look for in good API documentation. Some pretty common themes surfaced regarding best practices and pain points. We gathered a working list of documentation dos and don\u0026rsquo;ts and from there built a persona of our target user and mapped out their documentation user journey.\nInterview questions #We gathered responses from a total of 9 developers using a combination of live interviews and Google form polling. We sourced the participants from our personal contacts.\nHave you worked with APIs before? (all yes) When and why would you seek out API documentation? What is the first thing you look for in API documentation? What is something you frequently find you need in API documentation, but often discover is missing? What distinguishes good API documentation from poor documentation? Can you think of any examples of good API docs? What makes this example stand out? Are there any immediate telltale signs of bad API documentation? For example, if you were to take a quick glance at an API doc site, is there anything that would make you jump ship immediately? Key takeaways #Happily our interviewees pretty much agreed about what sets apart good docs from poor ones.\nAuthentication needs to be front and center. This is critical information that\u0026rsquo;s often hidden or just not included. If users can\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to authenticate, they can\u0026rsquo;t use the API.\nIf I cannot quickly determine how to be up and running using it (auth, make a basic call etc) then I will be annoyed and often look for another solution.\nDocs need to be quick to navigate and skim. Users don\u0026rsquo;t come to docs to read; they come to find a specific answer to a specific problem. Docs should be easy to navigate, scan, and search so devs can find what they need with minimal hunting.\nGood API documentation is well organized. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend time in the docs if I don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nTarget both new and seasoned users. Users need the docs for different reasons at each stage of the user journey. Good, thorough docs have both a user guide section (getting started, tutorials, and other conceptual content) and a thorough reference section listing all endpoints.\nLack of updates or out-of-date info is a big red flag. Old information means the docs aren\u0026rsquo;t reliable.\nExamples are key. Lots of examples in a variety of languages means users can get up and running quickly.\nDocs need troubleshooting info. Developers don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend time debugging the API through trial and error. Docs should provide guidance on errors and solutions.\nReference section should be comprehensive. The reference area should contain everything the API offers, with endpoints clearly organized.\nAPI is really nothing more than a contract that says, ‘doing x will result in y.’ You really need good documentation to know what to expect.\nPortrait of our target user #Using the findings gathered from our user interviews, we created a persona and empathy map of a typical API doc user and mapped out their documentation user journey.\nAll research artifacts were created with Figma.\nAPI user persona # Empathy map # User journey # ","date":null,"permalink":"/portfolio/api-doc-site/","section":"Portfolio","summary":"Starwipe API documentation site View project on Github","title":"Starwipe API Documentation Site"},{"content":"Training guide for a volunteer taking over the PTA sponsorship program\nView PTA training guide PDF I created this piece for the UW technical writing certificate which I completed in November 2023.\nOverview #I wrote a training guide for a parent volunteer taking on the role of sponsorship chair of my PTA.\nI am the current PTA sponsorship chair.

The document was originally completed in 2010 and adopted as our official in-house style guide. It was used for training incoming editors and interns and as a reference for our large pool of contributing freelance writers and content creators.\nThis project came about after I saw the need to create a standard set of guidelines defining our voice and editorial style to ensure we were training new hires effectively and uniformly. I pitched the idea for a style guide to the team and got the go-ahead to develop it myself.\nBackground #When I started at the company, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a style guide. We had a collection of loose guidelines and conventions generally agreed upon by the team, but they weren\u0026rsquo;t formalized or written down anywhere central. When it came time to train anyone new on our style (and this was often, as we contracted new freelancers on a regular basis), we\u0026rsquo;d send a list of bullet points over email. As you can guess, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the most reliable system and style rules were often communicated unevenly.\nAfter getting involved with hiring and training, it was clear to me that a style guide would be immensely helpful in ensuring that our team and all new hires were aligned on our voice and style.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/portfolio/style-guide/","section":"Portfolio","summary":"View style guide PDF I created this guide while working as an editorial assistant at Education.","title":"In-House Style Guide for Education.com"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a writer moving into technical communication with 6+ years of experience in product and web content in the tech industry.

Staff Writer | ArtSlant #2008-2009\nSan Francisco, CA\nArtSlant (now defunct) was an online art publication and artist portal, a community hub connecting artists, galleries, and art lovers in cities across the US and Europe.\nI was on their roster of writers for the SF Bay Area doing reviews of local art shows. I researched and selected the shows I wanted to review, attended, and wrote them up. I generally wrote two full reviews and 1 short-form \u0026ldquo;flavor piece\u0026rdquo; about local spots of aesthetic or cultural interest (piece of street art, funky alleyway, anything) per month.\nSadly I no longer have the work I did for ArtSlant, as the website was taken down and my local copies have been lost.\nGrant Writer | DunnWrite Communications #2007-2009\nRemote/freelance\nI worked freelance for a grant writing consulting firm.\nWrote and edited grant proposals and letters of inquiry for non-profit clients in youth advocacy and education.

Most recently I was a product manager at Education.com, an edtech startup based in the SF Bay Area (now owned by IXL). I\u0026rsquo;ve done a range of writing over the course of my career, with a focus on web content and bringing online products to life. Everything from product documentation and UX microcopy to art show reviews and instructional activities for kids.\nAfter becoming a parent in 2013, I took a career break to devote my time fully to raising my kids. Since coming back from hiatus in late 2022, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to return to my writing roots and pivot toward technical writing in this new chapter of work.\nIn November 2023 I completed the Technical Writing certificate program at the University of Washington.\nI may not have been called a technical writer in my past work, but I\u0026rsquo;ve created lots of documentation as a product manager and editor. Being part of a tiny two-person product team at a startup meant covering a wide range of roles and tasks\u0026ndash;everything from writing the FAQ and terms of service for a subscription product to creating an in-house style guide. I\u0026rsquo;ve also done a fair amount of UX writing and collaborated often with design and editorial to test and improve UX copy in user flows across the site.\nWhy technical writing? To me it feels like a natural progression that builds on my past work and weaves in many of my personal strengths and interests. It combines many of the elements of product management that I enjoyed like collaborating on cross-functional teams (particularly enjoyed working with engineers) with my love of words and user advocacy and learning new things and thinking through the intracacies of how best to structure and present information to make it as robust, accessible, and useful as possible to everyone who needs it.\nHobbies and interests #Before I was a writer, I was a reader. I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved words and narrative and the mechanics of storytelling. You\u0026rsquo;ll never find me without something to read. I\u0026rsquo;m partial to fiction but have lately gotten into listening to nonfiction. I\u0026rsquo;m also subscribed to a bunch of writers on Substack and probably spend as much time reading and thinking about the art and craft of writing as I do actually doing the thing.\nOther things I love:\nCooking and food Plants and working in the garden Intricate crafts that take forever to complete Fashion history and personal style Hiking in damp PNW woods Currently thinking about:\nDigital gardening Systems for personal knowledge management Alternative cultural and historical conceptions of time ","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Me","summary":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Kristi #I\u0026rsquo;m a writer making the jump into technical writing with a background in product and online content in the tech industry.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
